Trying out the classic with Rails 5.0.2

I'm a totally noob, and have ripped my hair trying to solve problems in my first try fallowing the instructions from the free book "Learning Ruby on Rails - book one" by Daniel Kehoe, got a lot of help from a very nice guy on Stackoverflow. Thank you wpp!

I'm now fallowing the hello-world classic tutorial from:
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Wish me the best!
